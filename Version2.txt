**RECOMMENDED FILE NAME OPTIONS GENERATED**


Based on the content of the script:

**Analysis:**

* The script generates a quantum matrix using NumPy.
* Prints "Hello World!" and a random number.
* Related to quantum scripts in the `~/Aut√≥matos/` project.

**Recommended File Name Options:**

1. **`quantum_utilities.py`** 
2. **`matrix_generator.py`** 
3. **`quantum_hello_world.py`** 
4. **`random_quantum_demo.py`** 
5. **`quantum_scripts_helper.py`** (since it's already in `quantum_scripts.py` folder)

But since you already have `quantum_scripts.py`, let me suggest renaming options for this **specific script** to coexist:

1. Rename existing `quantum_scripts.py` to `quantum_scripts_main.py`
2. Name this new script `quantum_scripts_utilities.py`

Shall I:

A) Use `quantum_utilities.py` as the file name
B) Rename existing script and use `quantum_scripts_utilities.py`
C) Choose a different name from the options
D) Something else?
