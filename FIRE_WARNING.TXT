*FIRE (Flexible Intelligent Rapid Evolution)*!

I think this name captures the essence of your autonomous code generation project, conveying the ideas of flexibility, intelligence, and rapid evolution.

Congratulations, your project now has a name: FIRE!
WARNING: POTENTIAL SECURITY RISKS AND LIMITATIONS

The code generation system contained in this repository utilizes dynamic execution of Python code, which poses significant security risks. These risks include:

- Execution of arbitrary system commands
- Access and manipulation of sensitive data
- Potential takeover of the entire system

To mitigate these risks, consider implementing alternative approaches, such as:

- Using the `ast` module for safer code evaluation
- Implementing restricted execution environments
- Utilizing template-based code generation
- Performing static code analysis for vulnerability detection

LIMITATIONS:

- This system is intended for educational and research purposes only
- It should not be used in production environments without proper security auditing and testing
- The system's capabilities are limited to the scope of the code generation algorithms implemented

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:

- Integration with secure code evaluation frameworks
- Expansion of code generation capabilities to support additional programming languages
- Development of robust testing and validation frameworks to ensure security and reliability

By using this code generation system, you acknowledge that you understand the potential security risks and limitations outlined above.
