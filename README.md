## Overview

FIRE (Flexible Intelligent Rapid Evolution) is an experimental autonomous code generation system written in Python. It aims to demonstrate the concept of self-evolving code creation by randomly selecting and executing predefined code snippets. Inspired by autonomous agents, this project explores the potential of dynamic, adaptive code generation.

**Key Features:**

* **Autonomous Code Generation:** Dynamically generates and executes Python code.
* **Rapid Prototyping:** Allows for quick exploration of code generation concepts.
* **Educational Tool:** Provides a platform for learning about dynamic code execution and autonomous systems.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Risks and Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è

**WARNING:** This project uses `exec()`, which poses significant security risks. It should **NOT** be used in production environments.

* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Potential for executing any Python code, including malicious commands.
* **System Access:** Risk of unauthorized access to system resources and sensitive data.

**Limitations:**

* Currently relies on a fixed list of code snippets.
* Infinite recursion issues exist.
* Limited error handling.
* Intended for educational and research purposes only.

**Mitigation Strategies (Planned):**

* Transition to safer code evaluation using the `ast` module.
* Implement restricted execution environments (e.g., `RestrictedPython`).
* Explore template-based code generation (e.g., `Jinja2`).
* Implement static code analysis for vulnerability detection.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.x

**Installation:**

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/OmegaPrimej/Aut-matos.git](https://github.com/OmegaPrimej/Aut-matos.git)
    cd Aut-matos
    ```

2.  Run the `genesis.py` script:

    ```bash
    python genesis.py
    ```

## Usage

Running `genesis.py` will initiate the autonomous code generation process. The system will randomly select and execute code snippets from the predefined list.

## Future Development

* Implement secure code evaluation frameworks.
* Expand code generation capabilities to support more complex scenarios.
* Develop robust error handling and logging mechanisms.
* Fix the Recursion Error.
* Add a method to alter the `code_snippets` variable.
* Integrate with LLMs.
